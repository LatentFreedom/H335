1. The accelerometer/magnetometer has 14 pins.

 1: Vdd_IO
 2: SCL
 3: SDA
 4: INT2
 5: INT1
 6: C1
 7: GND
 8: Reserved
 9: DRDY
10: Reserved

12: SETP
13: SETC
14: Vdd

The accelerometer/magnetometer requires 2.16V minimum and can go to 3.6V 
maximum.

The accelerometer/magnetometer is located on the right side of the board above
pin 5V and to the right of the power module.

2. We must write to the accelerometer/magnometer before we can read from
it because the device has no information to be read unless it is written
to. We have to provide data to the slaves to prep them for data retreival. 

3. The lines of code are saving the accelerometer data into a buffer that 
is provided.

4. Tilt compensation allows for a correct header reading and correct
direction displayed. The pitch and roll will change the final header
and this makes it so the pitch and roll need to be changed to level
out the header when the board is tilted.

Difficulties and successes:
There were a few difficulties for this lab. Some of the difficulties included
trying to find the correct degrees to display the right direction (e.g. North, 
South). The next difficulty came from reading through the documentation
and decifering how to compensate for tilt. After finding the formulas, the
problem was solved. However, the boards are not very accurate when it comes to
tilt compensation.
