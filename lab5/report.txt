1. How many connections are required to communicate over UART?

5 connections are required to communicate over UART.

2. What is the purpose of "alternate functions" for GPIO pins?

Alternate funcitons allow a peripheral to have alternative modes for IO.

3. Define "baud rate" in your own words.

A baud rate is the frequency that two clocks have agreed upon and are running 
at. The frequency is not guarenteed to be the exact same for each clock. 

4. Why do we need newlib_stubs? Specifically, is there a reason that printf 
won't work on the board without it?

newlib_stubs is a file that allows us to use putstring, getchar, and putchar. 
Without it we would not be able to use printf.

5. Give an example of a situation in which the Saleae Logic Analyzer is the
best debugging method and include a screen shot of the Logic application.

The Saleae Logic Analyzers is very helpful getting a visual for when and what is 
being transfered from computer to board.


The hardest part about this lab was figuring out the saleae logic analizer. 
I first downloaded the old version of the program and figured out I needed 
to download the the beta version. This lab was straight forward otherwise 
when it came to initializing pins and connecting wires for TX and RX.
