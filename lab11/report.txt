Difficulties and successes:
In the lab we had to implement interrupts and a circular queue. The circular queue had to pull and then 
put characters through the serialT in a FIFO (first in first out) implementation. After figuring out that 
the systick initializer would set the interrupt handler and we should put the code inside of the interrupt 
handler we got the LEDs to work. We had trouble getting the queue to work because it was not giving the 
right empty_queue output. We wrote a test main for our queue and found out that we were not modding (%) 
all our tail increments so that the tail was pushing out further than the size of the queue and would never 
be the same index as the head which our empty_queue checked. After modding where needed we got our queue to 
work. The next problem came with finding out why our serialT was not getting any output. We started to think 
that the interrupts and flushing were happening to fast but when we slowed them down we still did not get any 
output. We decided that we might have to somehow wait on the getchar with a while(1) loop so we can get the 
character before moving on. This was the issue and we finally were able to get an output.
