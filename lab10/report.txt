1. What are we doing here and how does it relate to what we know about SPI?

The macro SD_CS_HIGH() sets the bits  and SD_CS_LOW() resets the bits. This is like the chip select in SPI

2. Explain how you might use the *f3d_delay_uS()* function within the *delay()* function 
to replace the delay loop below. What would you expect to be the advantage of using a timer over a delay loop?

We use the board's processing instead of waiting and listening. The old delay has to check the assembly and see how 
many loops to run.

3. Read chapter 12 in the lab manual which covers DMA (direct memory access). Why might DMA be important in improving
the performance of your image display application?

The DMA shares the memory buses and peripheral buses with the CPU. There is no waiting to to hear from another bus because 
of this sharing.

4. Research the FAT file system and describe the function of the file allocation table. Explain how the corruption 
of an entry in the table can cause part of a file to be lost.

A FAT (file address table) is a table that an operating system uses to look up files on a disk. Because of fragmentation, 
files can be all over a computer and a FAT is used to keep track of where the files are located.

5. What is the difference between FAT16 and FAT32?

FAT32's uses 32bit addresses and 16bit addresses while FAT16 only uses 16bit addresses. FAT32 is used to create larger 
partitions. 

Difficulties and Successes:
Most of my time was spent on figuring out why the device was giving the error rc=3. After debugging for a 
few hours I fouund that I had swapped the macros for setting the chip select. After figuring out the problem
the code ran and I got the expected output. After that the lab was good. I went through and read some of the 
chapters in the lab manual that gave helpful ideas on how to implement the needed functionality.
